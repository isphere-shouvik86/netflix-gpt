# Copilot instructions — my-app (Create React App)

This repository is a standard Create React App (CRA) single-page React app. The goal of these instructions is to give immediate, actionable context so an AI coding agent can make safe, focused changes.

- **Project root:** `package.json`, `README.md`, `public/`, `src/`
- **Main entry:** `src/index.js` (uses `ReactDOM.createRoot` and `React.StrictMode`)
- **Primary UI component:** `src/App.js` (functional component, default export)

Why this structure matters
- The app uses `react-scripts` (CRA). Do not attempt to change webpack or build config unless the user explicitly ejects (`npm run eject`).
- The project expects conventional CRA scripts: `npm start`, `npm test`, `npm run build`.

Key files and patterns to reference
- `src/index.js`: mounting root; keep `React.StrictMode` unless asked to remove it for debugging strict-mode issues.
- `src/App.js`: simple functional component pattern; components use default exports.
- `src/components/` and `src/utils/`: place new components and helpers here. Prefer creating a folder per component (e.g. `src/components/MyComponent/MyComponent.js`) with optional CSS file.
- `public/index.html`: static HTML shell; required meta tags live here.
- `package.json`: lists dependencies (React 19.x, `react-scripts` 5.x) — rely on these versions when suggesting packages or APIs.

Developer workflows (commands to run)
- Start dev server (PowerShell):
  - `npm start`
  - App served at `http://localhost:3000` by default.
- Run tests (interactive):
  - `npm test`
  - For CI-style run: `npm test -- --watchAll=false --runInBand`
- Build for production:
  - `npm run build` (output in `build/`)

Project-specific conventions
- Prefer functional components with default exports (see `src/App.js`).
- Keep styling alongside components when appropriate (`ComponentName.css` in same folder). Global styles live in `src/index.css`.
- Do not add build tools or change `react-scripts` behavior without explicit user instruction (eject is destructive).
- Tests use `@testing-library/*`. When adding tests, follow existing import style and place tests alongside files (`MyComponent.test.js`).

Integration & data flow notes
- This repo is a client-only CRA app (no server code in repo). If network calls are added, expect fetch/XHR from client code; document any new environment variables in the `README.md`.
- No existing API client layer is present. If you add one, place it under `src/utils/` and export a small interface (e.g., `api.getSomething()`).

Editing guidance for AI agents
- Make minimal, easily reviewable changes. Prefer small commits/PRs that change a single concern.
- When adding files, follow the existing tree: `src/components`, `src/utils`.
- Run `npm start` locally to smoke-test UI changes and `npm test` to verify no test regressions.
- Avoid adding or upgrading major dependencies without user consent. If proposing a dependency, include the rationale and a minimal usage example.

Examples from this repo
- Component pattern: `src/App.js` uses
  ```js
  function App() { return (<div className="App">...</div>); }
  export default App;
  ```
- Mount pattern: `src/index.js` uses `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(...)`.

If something is unclear
- Ask for clarification when changes affect build configuration, dependency versions, or global project behavior (e.g., removing `React.StrictMode`, running `eject`, switching test runner).

Next step for maintainers
- Review this file and tell the agent whether to:
  - proceed with small UI/code changes and tests, or
  - prepare a branch with a proposed dependency upgrade or architecture change.
